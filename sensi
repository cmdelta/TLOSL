Sensitivity is defined as the number of photons emitted from unit mass of quartz (feldspar) which is radiated unit dose.
Sensitivity varied greatly, and differ by more than ten orders of magnitude. However, the reason causes this phenomenon is still under study. 
Some of preliminary results show that the sensitivity was affected by source rock characteristics, sendimentary process or weathering condition.
Here we collected 16 igneous rocks from China, most of which are granite. Quartz was extracted from rock under precise procedure.	180-250 Î¼m quartz was measured in this study.
Sensitivity of thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) was measured on Lexsyg Smart platform, and calculated by Excel VBA programme which developed by author.
The preliminary results show that the sensitivity of TL decreases with the increase of sample age, and this is consistent with previous study (Han Zhiyong from Hong Kong University). The sensitivity of OSL does not show regular patterns.
